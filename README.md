moee/ZendSkeletonApplication
============================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application based on the
[ZendSkeletonApplication](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication).

This project is meant to be a first start for me with ZF2 as well as a
clean starting point for new projects.


Set up / Installation
---------------------
This project uses [phing](http://www.phing.info/) as build system. After
checking out the project, run the following commands:

* ```php phar.composer update```
* ```php phar.compuser install```
* ```phing setup```
* Create the database and import vendor/zf-commons/zfc-user/data/schema.sql
